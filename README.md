# Pyber_Analysis
## Overview
PyBer, a ride-sharing company valued at $2.3 billion, was interested in exploring trends in rideshare data from January to May 2019. Included in the datasets were the following fields:
* city
* driver_count
* type
* date
* fare
* ride_id

### Purpose
The purpose of the analysis was to identify differences in ride-sharing patterns between city types to inform decision-making at PyBer. In particular, the goal is to improve accress to ridesharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

### Analysis
#### Ride-Share DataFrame
First, the two datasets, city_data.csv and ride_data.csv, were merged on the city variable to create a single dataframe. Next, groupby was used to summarize new series variables by city type. The resulting series were then combined into a new dataframe and formatted to show the ride-share data by city type.

#### Total Weekly Fares by City Type Plot

A plot was produced to illustrate the total weekly fares by city type.
